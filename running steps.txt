	And then upload this jar to a folder on a specific server, then copy it, and after then open the Linux terminal or the putty for the specific 

	server, and first in this we copy the jar file to a specific location and then execute the supervisorctl command, and after then write the command to 		restart the project, like restart and project name, and then we need to see the current log to check the application starts or not by tailing the log.

	Here some below command which is use to run the project :

	
	cp /home/development/agent-services.jar : cp command is use to copy the project's jar file server location.

	supervisorctl : supervisorctl commannd is allows you to start, stop, restart, and monitor processes as services.

	restart agent-services : restart command is used to restart the project.

	tail -f /var/log/trace/agent-services.log : tail -f command is used to see the live log.
